Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset. It combines data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to generate personalized movie suggestions for users.

Features
📂 Data Loading: Import movies, ratings, tags, and links from MovieLens dataset.

🧮 Feature Extraction: Select userId and movieId as features, and rating as target.

🔀 Train/Test Split: Divide dataset into training and testing sets.

🤖 Model Training: Train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN).

📊 Evaluation: Compare models using RMSE and R² metrics.

🎯 Best Model Selection: Use the best-performing model for predictions.

🎬 Personalized Recommendations: Generate top movie suggestions for a given user.

🏷️ User Tags Integration: Display user-provided tags for recommended movies.

🌐 External Links: Include IMDb and TMDb identifiers for recommended movies.

📈 Visualization:
Heatmap for missing values in recommendation table

Barplot showing number of user tags per movie

Dataset
The project uses the MovieLens Latest Dataset (ml-latest/), which includes:

movies.csv → Movie details (title, genres)

ratings.csv → User ratings for movies

tags.csv → User-provided tags for movies

links.csv → External identifiers (IMDb, TMDb)
